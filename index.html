          <article class="content-box"><p>CDE Ventures combines the experience and skill sets of three members with backgrounds in Web design, Marketing, Branding, UX, Finance, and Accounting. With these skills they are equipped to solve the complex and dynamic problems of today's small businesses. Their knowledge and experience span across multiple industries with various different types of companies-from Financial Services to social media marketing for independent films. Amongst the three members they have worked on over 40 companies in all stages--from startups to Fortune 500 Companies. Members of the company have assisted in creating and successfully launching Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns, as well as garnering over 15,000 views on YouTube. Their core understanding of business and their real-time grasp of the shifting landscape of media makes CDE a one stop shop for any business at any stage. </p>
            <p>CDE's focus is on businesses across Los Angeles that are looking to expand operations, grow sales, and lower their costs. Their target market consists of companies in the $5M to $15M range that lack the systems and infrastructures to efficiently grow their operations and become market leaders in their perspective spaces. </p>
